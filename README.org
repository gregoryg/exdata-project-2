* Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project 2
** Introduction

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong
evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for
fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximately
every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known
as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at
the [[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html][EPA National Emissions Inventory web site]].

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were
emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use
for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

** Data

The data for this assignment are available from the course web site and ultimately
comprise two files:


   1. PM2.5 Emissions Data
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002,
     2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from
     a specific type of source for the entire year. Here are the first few rows.
    #+END_QUOTE
   2. Source Classification Code Table
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to
     the actual name of the PM2.5 source. The sources are categorized in a few different
     ways from more general to more specific and you may choose to explore whatever
     categories you think are most useful. For example, source "10100101" is known
     as "Ext Comb /Electric Gen /Anthracite Coal /Pulverized Coal".

** Questions

*** Question 1. 
    Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?

    Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all
    sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.


**** Answer 
     PM2.5 emissions in the USA have declined in each of the successive years 1999-2008

*** Question 2. 
    Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips ==
    "24510") from 1999 to 2008?

    Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

**** Answer:
     PM2.5 emissions in Baltimore have declined between 1999 and 2008, but not steadily.

*** Question 3. 
    Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad)
    variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999-2008
    for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999-2008?  

    Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
**** Answer
     Of the four types of vehicles, only the Point category has not seen a steady decrease
     in PM2.5 emissions.

*** Question 4. 
    Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources
    changed from 1999-2008?
**** Answer
     Emissions from coal combustion-related sources have declined in the USA between 1999
and 2008
[[./plot4.png]]
*** Question 5. 
    How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999-2008 in Baltimore
    City?
**** Answer
     Motor vehicle emissions in Baltimore have declined year-over-year between 1999 and 2008
[[./plot5.png]]
*** Question 6. 
    Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from
    motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city
    has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
**** Answer
    Los Angeles has seen greater percentage changes in motor vehicle emissions, and has
not seen a decline between 1999 and 2008.  Baltimore has seen less fluctuation, smaller
percentage changes, and has steadily lowered PM2.5 emissions in those same years
